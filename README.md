# Classificatore-Lingue
This program ranks various Latin-alphabet languages based on the average frequency of each letter in words of that language (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency).
I made this program in 2018 during the "Systems and networks" lessons at ITIS Enrico Fermi in Modena with Python 2.7.
I have suitably modified it so that it can also work on the most modern versions of Python.
The script doesn't parse special characters or accents, I wanted to keep it simple and it often gets it right anyway.
